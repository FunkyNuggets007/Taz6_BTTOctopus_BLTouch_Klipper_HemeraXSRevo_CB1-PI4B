This is still a work in progress, but it is capable of printing with this hardware configuration :)
I have printed a calibration cube, a cup, and a retraction settings test.  All printed just fine, but as usual, make sure to check the pinout of your hardware. 

I will upload photos later to show my hardware placement to hopefully allow someone to better utilize this config.
