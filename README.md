Update: Project is complete,  100% working! :)

I have printed a calibration cube, a cup, and a retraction settings test, and lots others.  All printed just fine, but as usual, make sure to check the pinout of your hardware. 

I added a few photos to hopefully help anyone on where to place any wiring, etc.  These photos are for reference only, as some tweaking on the config will/may be done before/after they have been uploaded
