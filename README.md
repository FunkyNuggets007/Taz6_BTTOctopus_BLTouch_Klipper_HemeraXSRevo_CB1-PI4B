This is still a work in progress, but it is capable of printing with this hardware configuration :)
I have printed a calibration cube, a cup, and a retraction settings test.  All printed just fine, but as usual, make sure to check the pinout of your hardware. 

I added a few photos to hopefully help anyone on where to place any wiring, etc.  These photos are for reference only, as some tweaking on the config will/may be done before/after they have been uploaded
